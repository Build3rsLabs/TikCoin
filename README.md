# About TikCoin

TikCoin is a decentralized platform that empowers content creators by allowing them to launch their own tokens and reward their communities. Inspired by platforms like PumpFun, TikCoin fosters direct creator-fan monetization through personalized creator tokens.

Each creator token operates on a bonding curve, enabling early supporters to benefit as the creator's popularity grows. This symbiotic model incentivizes fans to discover and support emerging creators while allowing creators to monetize their influence in a decentralized way.

# ðŸ“ˆ Bonding Curve Economics

TikCoin employs a linear bonding curve model:

Token sales follow the same curve in reverse

Creator and platform fees apply to transactions

Formula:Price = BasePrice + (Slope * Supply)This ensures a transparent, fair pricing mechanism that rewards early supporters.
